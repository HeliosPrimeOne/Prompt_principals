Therefore, each triangular face contributes 2 unique edges that do not belong to the base.\n\nSince there are 5 triangular faces, and each contributes 2 unique edges:\n\nUnique edges from the triangular faces = 5 triangles * 2 edges/triangle = 10 edges\n\nNow, we add the edges of the base:\n\nTotal edges = edges of the base + unique edges from the triangular faces\nTotal edges = 5 edges (pentagon) + 10 edges (triangular faces)\nTotal edges = 15 edges\n\nTherefore, a pentagonal pyramid has 15 edges in total."
