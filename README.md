# Atlas: A LLM Inquiry Principle Benchmark

This repository contains resources and research on formulating effective queries and prompts for large language models (LLMs). The primary contribution is the introduction of 26 guiding principles aimed at optimizing interactions with LLMs of various scales, such as LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

## Overview

Our work aims to simplify the underlying concepts of formulating questions for different scales of large language models. By examining their abilities and enhancing user comprehension, we focus on optimizing the design of instructions and prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on models like LLaMA-1/2 and GPT-3.5/4 have verified the effectiveness of the proposed principles. 

## Data Release

Our dataset, comprising 0.5k data points, supports the study of LLM prompting principles. The data is curated to facilitate understanding and application of the 26 principles. 
Data can be found in  `data.json`. This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:

- `instruction`: describes the task the model should perform.
- `output`: the answer to the instruction as generated by `gpt-4-1106-preview`.
